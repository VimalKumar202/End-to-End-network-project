🌐 Network Components
🔹 Routers

Router1 (Left - ISR 4331)

Interfaces:

Gig0/0/0 → 10.0.0.7/8 (LAN side)

Gig0/0/1 → 192.168.100.2/24 (MPLS side, Primary link)

Router2 (Right - ISR 4321)

Interfaces:

Gig0/0/0 → 192.168.1.7/24 (LAN side)

Gig0/0/1 → 192.168.10.1/24 (MPLS side, Primary link)

Router0 (Middle - ISR 4351)

Acts as a P2P Backup Router

Interfaces:

Gig0/0/0 → 10.0.0.10/8 (LAN A side)

Gig0/0/1 → 192.168.1.10/24 (LAN B side)

🔹 Switches

Switch0 (Left – 2960-24TT)

Connected to Router1

Distributes IPs in LAN A (10.0.0.0/8)

Connected to:

PC0 → 10.0.0.1

PC1 → 10.0.0.2

Switch1 (Right – 2960-24TT)

Connected to Router2

Distributes IPs in LAN B (192.168.1.0/24)

Connected to:

PC2 → 192.168.1.1

PC3 → 192.168.1.2

🔹 PCs

LAN A (Left):

PC0 → 10.0.0.1

PC1 → 10.0.0.2

LAN B (Right):

PC2 → 192.168.1.1

PC3 → 192.168.1.2

📡 Connectivity Flow

Primary Link (MPLS):

Connects Router1 ↔ Router2 via 192.168.100.2/24 and 192.168.10.1/24.

Used as the main communication channel between LAN A and LAN B.

Backup Link (P2P via Router0):

If MPLS fails, traffic flows through Router0.

Router0 provides a direct point-to-point backup path using 10.0.0.10/8 ↔ 192.168.1.10/24.
