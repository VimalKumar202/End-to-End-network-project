# End-to-End Network Building & Configuration Project

This project demonstrates an **enterprise-level network design and configuration** built in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The network includes **MPLS as the primary link** and a **P2P backup link**, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance.

---

## 🖥️ Project Overview
- Designed a **company-wide LAN/WAN architecture**
- Configured routers, switches, and end devices with proper IP addressing
- Implemented **Primary (MPLS)** and **Backup (P2P)** connections
- Verified connectivity across multiple subnets
- Demonstrated redundancy and failover
